Had many issues with this assignemnt. Could not figure out how to have True -> "true" and False -> "false". 
It was saying that it expected an integer and I'm not sure why. Because of this isZero does not work correctly. 
The If statment, plus, and multiply work but if you pass the If statement an IsZero expression it will not work.

Because of the issues I am having only tests 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 16 evaluate correctly.
