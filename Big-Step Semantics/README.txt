Took me many attempts to get this working. At first I tried passing integers but came to the realization that passing it as a string and then casting it to an int when needed would be best. Since it needs to return a string this is the best way. 

For the exception I'm not sure if you wanted an actual exception so it exits after receiving an invalid expression or if you wanted it to return "Eval_Error", if you just wanted it to return the string it would be an easy change.
