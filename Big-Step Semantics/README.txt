Took me many attempts to get this working. Finally got it working with the function eval returning a type exp.

You can use the function print_eval to print out the tests. This function calls function string_of_exp with function eval as a parameter to print out the expression.
For example with test 1 the code is print_eval(True);;

The code passes all 20 Tests in order.
